"""
Task management for the task queue workers

B{AsynQueue} provides asynchronous task queueing based on the Twisted
framework, with task prioritization and a powerful worker
interface. Worker implementations are included for running tasks
asynchronously in the main thread, in separate threads, and in
separate Python interpreters (multiprocessing).
